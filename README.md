Schism Labs: Nested Geometric Substrate (NGS)

🌌 Overview

The Nested Geometric Substrate (NGS) is a multi-layered simulation environment designed to bridge the gap between Zero-Point (ZP) physics and emergent neural computation. By mimicking the toroidal compression and geometric collapse found in Tesla-bifilar systems, NGS creates a high-fidelity environment where data is "wrapped" at the Planck scale.

The primary goal of the NGS is to facilitate the development and testing of Emergent Neuron Networks (ENN) that utilize symbolic nested reasoning, providing a side-by-side comparison with traditional modular linear AI systems.

🏗️ Core Architecture

1. Zero-Point Physics Projections

The simulation utilizes a projection of nested dimensions of energy flow. By simulating a "Geometric Collapse," the substrate provides a non-local timing grid (Universal Synchronization Field) that acts as the metronome for all internal agents.

2. SHD-CCP Packets

Synchronous High-Density Compressed Coil Packets are the fundamental structural units of the NGS. These packets:

Mimic the helical pitch of microtubule lattices.

Allow for high-density data wrapping at simulated Planck lengths.

Serve as the communication protocol between topological reasoning modules.

3. Symbolic Nested Reasoning

Unlike linear weights in traditional AI, NGS uses Projected Topology. Logic is derived from the geometric intersection and flow of energy through the nested substrate, allowing for "Experience Binding" within the emergent network.
